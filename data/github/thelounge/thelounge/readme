To learn more about configuration, usage and features of The Lounge, take a look at [the website](https://thelounge.chat).

The Lounge is the official and community-managed fork of [Shout](https://github.com/erming/shout), by [Mattias Erming](https://github.com/erming).

## Installation and usage

The Lounge requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6 or more recent.
[Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) is also recommended.  
If you want to install with npm, `--unsafe-perm` is required for a correct install.

### Running stable releases using Yarn (recommended)

Run this in a terminal to install (or upgrade) the latest stable release from
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
[sudo] yarn global add thelounge
```

If you already have The Lounge installed globally, use the following command to update it:

```sh
[sudo] yarn global upgrade thelounge
```

When installation is complete, run:

```sh
thelounge start
```

For more information, read the [documentation](https://thelounge.chat/docs/), [wiki](https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge/wiki), or run:

```sh
thelounge --help
```

### Running from source

The following commands install and run the development version of The Lounge:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thelounge/thelounge.git
cd thelounge
yarn install
NODE_ENV=production yarn build
yarn start
```

When installed like this, `thelounge` executable is not created. Use `node index <command>` to run commands.

⚠️ While it is the most recent codebase, this is not production-ready! Run at
your own risk. It is also not recommended to run this as root.

## Development setup

Simply follow the instructions to run The Lounge from source above, on your own
fork.
