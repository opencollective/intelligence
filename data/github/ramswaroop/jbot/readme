Make bots in Java.

__JBot__ is a java framework _(inspired by [Howdyai's Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit))_ to
make Slack and Facebook bots in minutes. It provides all the boilerplate code needed so that you
can make your bot live right away.

## Why use JBot?

* Provides you with __all the boilerplate code__ which handles underlying websocket connections and other complexities.
* Supports __extra events__ in addition to all the events supported by Slack/Facebook which makes your work a lot more easier.
* __Receiving & sending messages__ is as easy as defining a `@Controller` and calling `reply()`.
* __Conversation feature__ of JBot makes talking to your bot a breeze. This feature makes JBot different than rest of the Java frameworks out there.
* __Well tested__ with good coverage unit tests.
* And many other features which can't just be mentioned here.

**Not satisfied?** Read on...

* JBot got more than __400 stars__ in just 2 days after release.
* It is in the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12239667) 50 club.
* Chosen by [DZone daily picks](http://mailer.dzone.com/display.php?M=15184241&C=dcebb6887365120539df1fbf19a071ed&S=9043&L=658&N=4604).
* Last but not the least, it's listed on [Slack.com](https://api.slack.com/community)

## JBot for Slack

**Running your SlackBot is just 4 easy steps:**
  
1. Clone this project `$ git clone git@github.com:ramswaroop/jbot.git`.  
2. [Create a slack bot](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) and get your slack token.  
3. Paste the token in [application.properties](/jbot-example/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.  
4. Run the example application by running `JBotApplication` in your IDE or via commandline: 
    ```bash
    $ cd jbot
    $ mvn clean install
    $ cd jbot-example
    $ mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

You can now start talking with your bot ;)

Read the detailed [Slack documentation](/docs/slack/README-Slack-JBot-4.0.0.md) to learn more.

## JBot for Facebook

**Similar to Slack, Facebook is simple too but has few extra steps:**

1. Clone this project `$ git clone git@github.com:ramswaroop/jbot.git`.
2. Create a [facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register#create-app) and a 
[page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create).
3. Generate a Page Access Token for the page (inside app's messenger settings).
4. Paste the token created above in [application.properties](/jbot-example/src/main/resources/application.properties) file.
5. Run the example application by running `JBotApplication` in your IDE or via commandline: 
    ```bash
    $ cd jbot
    $ mvn clean install
    $ cd jbot-example
    $ mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
6. Setup webhook to receive messages and other events. You need to have a public address to setup webhook. You may use
[localtunnel.me](https://localtunnel.me) to generate a public address if you're running locally on your machine.
7. Specify the address created above in "Callback Url" field under "Webooks" setting and give the verify token 
as `fb_token_for_jbot` and click "Verify and Save".

You can now start messaging your bot by going to the facebook page and clicking on the "Send message" button. 

_If you're too lazy to start now and just want to play around, you can try `jbot-example` by visiting 
[JBot facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jbotframework/) and clicking on the "Send Message" button._

Read the detailed [Facebook documentation](/docs/facebook/README-Facebook-JBot-4.0.0.md) to learn more.
