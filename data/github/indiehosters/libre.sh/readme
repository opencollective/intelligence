## Installation

[![ScreenShot](https://cloud.pierre-o.fr/index.php/apps/files_sharing/ajax/publicpreview.php?x=1364&y=283&a=true&file=preview.png&t=KlxYYFT59GirMJa&scalingup=0)](https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/libre_sh/)

To install it, follow the video above and instructions in `INSTALL.md`.

### What is libre.sh

libre.sh is a little framework to host Docker. It is simple and modular and respect the convention over configuration paradigm.

This is aimed at Hosters to manage a huge amount of different web application, and a quantity of domain names related with emails and so on.

It is currently installed at 3 different hosters in production and hosting ~20 different web applications, with ~500 containers.

Once well installed, in one bash command, you'll be able to:
 - buy a domain name
 - configure DNS for it
 - configure email for it
 - configure dkim for that domain
 - configure dmarc for that domain
 - configure autoconfig for that domain
 - install and start a web application on that domain (WordPress, Nextcloud, piwik...)
 - provision a TLS cert on that domain

Amazing, right?

### Modular

The PaaS is really modular, that's why it contains the strict necessary, then you'll probably want to add `system` modules or `applications`.

It contains 2 [unit-files](https://github.com/indiehosters/LibrePaaS/tree/master/unit-files) to manage system modules and applications, start them at boot, and load the appropriate environment.
