# Hello, slim.js

## Slim is a fast, native and elegant library for web components
Slim.js is a lightning fast library for development of native web-components and custom-elements based modern applications. No black magic involved.
It uses es6+DOM native API and boosts up HTML elements with superpowers. 

### Is this another framework
No! It's a slim code layer that adds superpowers to HTML elements, using the browser native capabilities.
But... wait! there's more:
- It has data binding
- It can be extended
- It feels like a framework (but in a good way)
- It's 5475 Bytes! (gzipped) Yep!
- Single file, good to go.
- No tools required, everything is based on native browser API. Choose your own tools.

## Standards compilant
- es6
- web-components V1
- no transpiling or compilation required

## Tools free
