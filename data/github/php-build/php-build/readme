# php-build [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/php-build/php-build.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/php-build/php-build)

php-build is a utility for building versions of PHP to use them side by side with each other. The overall structure is loosly borrowed from Sam Stephenson's [ruby-build].

## Installation

### As `phpenv` plugin

#### With CHH/[phpenv] via installer

It's the standard way: installs `phpenv` in $HOME/.phpenv (default
$PHPENV_ROOT value).

```shell
curl -L http://git.io/phpenv-installer \
    | bash
```

See more on https://github.com/rogeriopradoj/phpenv-installer: install [CHH/phpenv](https://github.com/CHH/phpenv) +
[php-build/php-build](https://github.com/php-build/php-build) (and
other plugins), updating all of them when you want to!

#### With `phpenv` manually

Locate your phpenv directory:

    % ls $HOME/.phpenv

Clone the Git repository into phpenv plugins directory:

    % git clone git://github.com/php-build/php-build.git $HOME/.phpenv/plugins/php-build

Now you can use php-build as phpenv plugin, as follows:

    % phpenv install <definition>

The built version will be installed into `$HOME/.phpenv/versions/<definition>`.

### As standalone `php-build`

Clone the Git Repository:

    % git clone git://github.com/php-build/php-build.git

Then go into the extracted/cloned directory and run:

    % ./install.sh

This installs `php-build` to the default prefix `/usr/local`.

To install php-build to an other location than `/usr/local` set the `PREFIX`
environment variable:

    % PREFIX=$HOME/local ./install.sh

If you don't have permissions to write to the prefix, then you have to run
`install.sh` as superuser, either via `su -c` or via `sudo`.
