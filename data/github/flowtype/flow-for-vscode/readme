# Flow for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds [Flow](https://flow.org/) support for VS Code. Flow is a static type checker, designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs. Follow the official guide to [get started](https://flow.org/en/docs/getting-started/).

Want to help make Flow in VS Code really shine? We're looking for [someone to help move this project](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/issues/148) to use the new [flow-language-server support in flow](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-language-server). This means the flow core team would add features, and this extension will get them for _almost free_. If this is you, you can get [set up for development](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) easily and then contrinute to [this WIP PR](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode/pull/150).

## Installation

Search for "flow" in the VS Code extensions panel or install through [the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=flowtype.flow-for-vscode).

## Setup
* Make sure you have a `.flowconfig` file in your workspace.
* Make sure you are able to run the `flow` command from the command line (or see [Configuration](#Configuration) to customize the command or use NPM packaged flow).
* Set `javascript.validate.enable` option to `false` **or** completely disable the built-in TypeScript extension for your project (see gif below):

## Configuration
You can specify a configuration by amending the VS Code `settings.json` file. Access this through Preferences â†’ Settings. You must reload VS Code after installing this extension for these settings to take affect.

* `flow.pathToFlow` (default: 'flow') path to Flow that will be used for VSCode (eg; `"${workspaceRoot}/node_modules/.bin/flow"`). 
* `flow.stopFlowOnExit` (default: true) stop flow server on exit from Project.
* `flow.enabled` (default: true) you can disable flow for some Project for example.
* `flow.useNPMPackagedFlow` (default: false) you can also run Flow by defining it in your `package.json`.
* `flow.showStatus` (default: `true`) If `true` will display a spinner in the status-bar while flow is type checking.
* `flow.runOnEdit` (default: `true`) If `true` will run flow on every edit, otherwise will run only when changes are saved.
* `flow.runOnAllFiles` (default: `false`) Run Flow on all files, No need to put `//@flow comment` on top of files.
* `flow.useLSP` (default: `false`) Run Flow through Language Server Protocol [EXPERIMENTAL].

## Known Issues

* There are some aspects of Flow syntax which are not supported by the default VS Code JavaScript grammar, if you're having problems with syntax try [JavaScript Atom Grammar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.js-atom-grammar).

## Debugger configuration

First, follow the [instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) to setup your launch configuration file, `launch.json`.
