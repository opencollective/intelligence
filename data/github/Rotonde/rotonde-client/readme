# Rotonde/client

**Rotonde** is a decentralized social network based on an equally *decentralized* application. The two parts of the application are as follows:

- The [client](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-client), the core of the application.
- The [portal](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-portal), the user files, settings and customization.

The client, or *Rotonde Core*, is what contributors need to make improvements on the inner systems of the application. This separation allows for a simpler onboarding and updating flow, where the latest client revision will be seeded automatically (read-only), while the [portal](https://github.com/Rotonde/rotonde-portal) source is all that any normal user needs to maintain.

## Getting Started

### For New Users

- First make sure you've downloaded the latest version of [Beaker Browser][]
- Then open it up and visit https://client-neauoire.hashbase.io
- Here you can fill out your username and upload an avatar.
- Hit Enter, follow the Beaker prompt, and enjoy your new Portal!

You can follow new users by dropping their dat url in the "operator" input at the top of your new portal. For an example, try `dat://daily-descent.hashbase.io/` to follow the daily-descent, a portal with regular news and updates about all-things P2P.

[Beaker Browser]: https://beakerbrowser.com

### Improve Your Portal's Uptime with Hashbase.io

- Go to https://hashbase.io
- Create Account, then Upload Archive
- For the URL, enter the Dat url you created above
- For the Name, enter "rotonde"

This will give your portal a clean name, something like dat://rotonde-dcposch.hashbase.io

Hashbase will ensure that your portal stays available even when you're offline.

> In case you're curious how these clean names work under the hood--they're references to opaque dat URLs. For example, Beaker resolves dat://daily-descent.hashbase.io/ by loading https://daily-descent.hashbase.io/.well-known/dat 

### For Developers

The goal of this tutorial is to have both a local client and portal.

- Clone both repositories in your `~/Sites`
- Create two sites using the [Beaker Browser](https://beakerbrowser.com) and point them to the user/client repositories.
- Update the `portal/index.html` file with your client site hash, found in the Beaker address bar or the *Share* button.
- Update the `client/dat.json` with the client site hash, and the `portal/dat.json` with the portal hash.
- Enjoy!
