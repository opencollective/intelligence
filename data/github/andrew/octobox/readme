## Why is this a thing?

If you manage more than one active project on GitHub, you probably find [GitHub Notifications](https://github.com/notifications) pretty lacking.

Notifications are marked as read and disappear from the list as soon as you load the page or view the email of the notification. This makes it very hard to keep on top of which notifications you still need to follow up on. Most open source maintainers and GitHub staff end up using a complex combination of filters and labels in Gmail to manage their notifications from their inbox. If, like me, you try to avoid email, then you might want something else.

Octobox adds an extra "archived" state to each notification so you can mark it as "done". If new activity happens on the thread/issue/pr, the next time you sync the app the relevant item will be unarchived and moved back into your inbox.

## Getting Started

### Octobox.io

You can use Octobox right now at [octobox.io](https://octobox.io), a shared instance hosted by the Octobox team.

**Note:** octobox.io has a few features intentionally disabled:

* Subject syncing (includes authorship and open/closed/merged status information) ([#411](https://github.com/octobox/octobox/pull/411))
* Auto refreshing of notifications page ([#200](https://github.com/octobox/octobox/pull/200))
* Personal Access Tokens ([#185](https://github.com/octobox/octobox/pull/185))

Features are disabled for various reasons, such as not wanting to store users' tokens at this time.
Some features might never be enabled, and some just might have other prerequisite work pending completion.

### Install

You can also host Octobox yourself! See [the installation guide](docs/INSTALLATION.md)
for installation instructions and details regarding deployment to Heroku, Docker, and more.

### Desktop usage

You can run Octobox locally as a desktop app too if you'd like, using [Nativefier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativefier):

```bash
npm install -g nativefier
nativefier "https://octobox.io" # Or your own self-hosted URL
```

This will build a local application (.exe, .app, etc) and put it in your current folder, ready to use.

### Web extension

You can also install the cross-browser [Octobox Web Extension](https://github.com/tfrommen/octobox-web-extension). It is available for [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octobox-web-extension/efhkcafmbonnomnimilnephjgeccffdn) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/octobox-web-extension/), but you can also use it with other browsers that support web extensions.

## Requirements

[Web notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications) must be enabled in your GitHub settings for Octobox to work.

## Keyboard shortcuts

You can use keyboard shortcuts to navigate and perform certain actions:

 - `a` - Select/deselect all
 - `r` or `.` - Refresh list
 - `j` - Move down the list
 - `k` - Move up the list
 - `s` - Star current notification
 - `x` - Mark/unmark current notification
 - `y` or `e` - Archive current/marked notification(s)
 - `m` - Mute current/marked notification(s)
 - `d` - Mark current/marked notification(s) as read here and on GitHub
 - `o` or `Enter` - Open current notification in a new window

Press `?` for the help menu.
