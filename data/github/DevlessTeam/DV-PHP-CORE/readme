## Devless is a tool for ready-made back-end for development of web or mobile applications. It is fully open source under the permissive Apache v2 license. This means that you can develop your front end without worrying about neither back-end code or the business risk of a propitiatory backend-as-a-service.
 
## DevLess provides the perfect starting point for your next big idea. Forget all the boilerplate and focus on what matters: your APPLICATION and USERS its like Laravel Spark and also comes with the ease Parse(RIP) had. https://devless.io/

**How?**

**Well first upto 93% of the things you do on DevLess is pure configuration via GUI**

**For example this is how you create tables on DevLess (migration equivalence in frameworks)*
![Tables Image](http://fs5.directupload.net/images/161228/6mzzjt8c.png)

**Deciding on which table to make  available to end users via automagically generated APIs is just a tab away**

 **Working with Data is a joy**

**Deployment is a breeze all you have to do is export your app and import it into another DevLess instance on the cloud could be via our [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/eddymens/devless/)**

**Devless API Engine(DAE)** is an opensource API engine that allows CRUD access to databases as well as execute PHP scripts and rules. 

Current implementation of the Devless API Engine is in PHP and built on top of the Laravel framework. 

**DAE** can be used as a standalone (accessed solely via API calls) however a management console is provided to interact with the API engine.



**Requirements**
* Database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLSRV etc..)
* An HTTP server
* PHP >= 5.5.9
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* Composer

**Installation procedure**
* Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/DevlessTeam/DV-PHP-CORE.git` 
* Change into directory `cd DV-PHP-CORE`
* run `composer install` to grab dependecies
* copy .env.example to .env `cp .env.example .env` and update the database options
* run migrations with `./devless migrate`
* `./devless serve`

If everything goes on smoothly you should be able to access the setup screen at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

If you will need help setting up you may check out the Laravel [installation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.1) guide as the Devless core is based off of Laravel.

Alternatively, you can deploy your own copy unto Heroku😎
