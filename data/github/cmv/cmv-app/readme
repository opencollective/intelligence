## Introduction
[CMV](https://cmv.io/) is a community-supported open source mapping framework. CMV works with the [Esri JavaScript API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/3/), [ArcGIS Server](https://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver), [ArcGIS Online](https://arcgis.com/) and more.

## Make It Your Own!
This JavaScript web app can be easily configured or used as a boilerplate/starting point for basic viewers. It also demonstrates best practices for modular design and OOP via classes in JS using dojo's great [declare](https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.9/dojo/_base/declare.html) system.
