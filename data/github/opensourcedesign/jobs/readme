# Jobs

The goal here is to create a proper **"job board"** that pairs open source people and projects in need design work with designers who can do those tasks.
It will be a mixture of *both gratis as well as paying work.*
A job can be relatively small task to an entire project.
I think the ideal balance would be a mixture of about:

* 25% small singular tasks
* 15% new or fork of an existing project
* 60% product / feature development on existing projects

*Note: this process is rough and a work in progress, please free to contribute ideas, approaches, and of course jobs :)*

## Submit a Job

Our job submission process is done **"in the open"** so if you work on an open source software project or community, feel free to submit a job to our job board. Just do the following:

**Easy Web Form**

1. Go to [our form](http://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/job-form/) and fill in the details,
2. Submit the form,
3. Wait for us to approve your job posting,
4. Have a margarita or a hot chocolate.

**Using Terminal (for nerds)**

1. Fork the `jobs` repo
2. Copy `job-template.md` into the `jobs` folder and change the name
3. Name your copy something like `2015-03-12-sticker-design-for-fun.md` starting with date
4. Make sure there is a `.md` extension to the file you copied or it won't work
5. Fill out the fields inside the template you just copied
6. Submit a pull request
7. Have a margarita or hot chocolate

After those steps you will have submitted a job to the OSD job board, you rule ;)
